					<h3><strong>Borscht</strong></h3>
					<p>Borscht is a famous Russian dish, though it actually originated in Ukraine. It is a red, beet-based soup, with various other ingredients such as carrots, beef, and cabbage adding flavor and substance. It is served hot, with a scoop of sour cream on top. There are dozens of variations of the recipe of the soup itself, however. One of these many delicious variations can be found <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/borscht-357129">here</a>.</p>

					<h3>Kiev Cake</h3>
					<p>This cake originated in Kiev, Ukraine in the twentieth century but has since become very popular across both Ukraine and Russia. The cake is composed in layers: light, airy cake layers, hazelnuts, jam, and a filling that resembles buttercream. Most people simply go and buy this cake from a store, but <a href="http://momsdish.com/recipe/126/kiev-cake">making it</a> isn't much of a hassle, either.</p>
