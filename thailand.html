					<h3>Chicken Spring Rolls</h3>
					<p>While in a traditional Thai meal, appetizers are more like smaller entres brought out to share among a family during the rest of the meal, foods such as the spring roll can be easily used as an appetizer that Western countries are more familiar with. <a href="http://www.thaikitchen.com/Recipes/Appetizers/Chicken-Spring-Rolls">Spring rolls with a dipping sauce</a> would be a delicious light starter for the meal.</p>
